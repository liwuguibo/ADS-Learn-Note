# ADS-Learn-Note

**"Very little is new in RF anymore. Almost everything that we see today is a variation on a very old and well understood theme"-- C. Marki**

## About this repo
This repository is my ADS learn note, and will be updated according to my study progress.

Based on ADS2024.

Each folder contains one compressed file and each compressed file is a workspace after unzip.

**This repo is not a note on Google Ads or Facebook Ads. It is a note on Advanced Design System, which is an EDA tool.**

**Before using these simulation files, please check the textbooks below.**

**A really good Smith Chart tool developed by Fritz Dellsperger can be accessed [here](http://www.fritz.dellsperger.net/smith.html).**
