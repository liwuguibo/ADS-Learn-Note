## AMP_BPF650
A workspace about how to make a BJT to an amplifier. PCB files will be uploaded later.

[BFP650](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/rf/rf-transistor/high-linearity-rf-transistors/bfp650) is a high linearity low noise SiGe:C NPN RF transistor manufactured by Infineon.

It works at 2GHz, and gain is 18dB. 

More information abou P1dB and IP3 can be found in simulation files.
